# Movie Recommendation System
DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT 
This project is a voice-controlled movie recommendation chatbot. It allows users to speak the name of a movie, and the system will recommend similar movies based on genres using TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) and cosine similarity.
The chatbot interacts with users through speech recognition (for listening) and text-to-speech (for replying), making the experience completely hands-free.

Technologies Used : 
Python Libraries : 
speech_recognition → to capture and understand user’s voice.
pyttsx3 → to speak responses.
pandas → for handling movie dataset.
scikit-learn (sklearn) → for TF-IDF and cosine similarity.

Features:
1.Voice input: No typing needed, fully hands-free.
2.Voice output: The chatbot talks back to you.
3.Personalized recommendations: Suggests similar movies to the one you like.
4.Continuous conversation: Keeps chatting until you say “no.”
